# poiesis

From Wikipedia:

Poïesis is etymologically derived from the ancient Greek term ποιέω, which 
means "to make". This word, the root of our modern "poetry", was first a verb,
an action that transforms and continues the world. Neither technical production
nor creation in the romantic sense, poïetic work reconciles thought with matter
and time, and man with the world.
